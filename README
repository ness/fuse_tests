Currently only an inmemory filesystem, it is uncomplete and has several places that need some work:

- readlink is not working properly
- the xattr stuff is just there so it stores stuff
- rename is not keeping track of the references
- statfs is also just there (copied from the example from fusepy)
- propably many thins more


It does what I wanted it to do, nothing more nothing less
